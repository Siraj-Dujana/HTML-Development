<!-- HTML Tags
If you want to build a beautiful website, tags are essential elements that help you achieve that.
An HTML tag acts as a container for content or other HTML tags. Tags are words enclosed within < and > angle brackets.
They serve as keywords that instruct the web browser on how to format and display the content. -->
<!-- There are two types of tags -->
<!-- Paired and Unpaired HTML Tags -->
<!-- Paired Tags -->
<!-- These are tags that come in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag. The content goes between these two tags.
Opening Tag: The opening tag starts with < and ends with >. For example, <p>.
Closing Tag: The closing tag also starts with < but includes a forward slash / before the tag name, and ends with >. For example, </p>. -->
<!-- Unpaired Tags -->
<!-- These are tags that don't require a closing tag. They are self-contained, encapsulating all the information within a single tag.
Self-Closing Tag: A self-closing tag starts with < and ends with /> (though the / is optional in HTML5). For example, <img /> or <br>. -->
