    <!-- Inline Elements -->
    <!-- Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are part of the flow
    within other elements.

    Inline elements can contain other inline elements, but they generally should not contain block-level elements. For
    example, you could nest a <strong> (strong emphasis) element within a <span> (a generic inline container) element,
            like so: -->

            <span>This is <strong>important</strong> text.</span>

            <!-- Common Inline Elements
            <span>: A generic inline container for text
            <a>: Defines a hyperlink
            <strong>: Defines important text
            <em>: Defines emphasized text
            <img>: Embeds an image
            <input>: Defines an input control -->
